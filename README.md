## Description
Ping Pong is a simple game that is used for checking numbers that are divisible by 3 only those that are divisible by 5 only and finally those divisible by 15 only.

The user inputs a number on the field marked *Enter your Number* (any number). The system then generate the numbers from 1 to the number that the user has submitted and replaces  the numbers divisible by three only with *Ping*, those that are divisible by 5 only with *Pong* and those that are divisible by 15 only with *Ping-Pong*.

## Setup/Installation Requirements
There are no installation requirments needed... with your web browser you can be able to play the game.

## Known Bugs
There is a small issue that will be fixed in the coming days... an auto-refresh. So that the user does ot see a build up of more numbers when he/she inputs a second number in the input field. 

## Technologies Used

The game was build mainly with HTML CSS and JAVASCRIPT... there s also the use of bootstrap.min.css used to style some parts of the Webpage and Jquery used to call some functions.
